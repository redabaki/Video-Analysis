# Video-Analysis

## Objective
Implementing the DeepSORT tracking algorithm (without additional training) combined with YOLOv5
for object detection. Applying this setup to video sequences from the MOT Challenge dataset to
track pedestrians and evaluate the tracking performance using MOTA. Additionally, count the
number of people in each frame.
